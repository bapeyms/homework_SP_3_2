A small gray cat named Milo lives in a cozy house near a sunny garden.
He loves chasing butterflies and watching birds from the window every morning.
Milo has soft fur, bright eyes, and very long whiskers.
Every afternoon, he sleeps quietly on a warm pillow in the living room.
At night, he becomes curious and explores every corner of the house.
Sometimes he plays with a tiny ball and runs across the hallway.
His favorite food is fish, and he always waits patiently for dinner.
When it rains, Milo sits by the window and listens to the gentle sounds outside.
He often wakes up at midnight and meows softly for attention.
Milo is friendly, playful, and brings joy to everyone in the family.
